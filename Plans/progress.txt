## Codebase Patterns
- OAuth flow: Frontend at App.jsx redirects to /auth when shop param present, auth.js redirects to Shopify OAuth, callback.js exchanges code and stores token in Parameter Store
- Parameter Store path: `/shopify/clients/{shop}/access-token` (SecureString), `/scopes`, `/installed-at`
- Frontend uses Polaris UI components and App Bridge for Shopify admin embedding
- Lambda functions in backend/functions/ handle all API endpoints

## 2026-01-09 - Story 100 & 101

- **What was implemented**: Verified OAuth authentication and redirect flows
- **Files reviewed**:
  - `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Auto-redirect to /auth on install
  - `backend/functions/auth.js` - OAuth initiation with HMAC state
  - `backend/functions/callback.js` - Token exchange and redirect to UI
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - App.jsx handles three scenarios: embedded (has host), post-install (has shop+installed), and direct access (redirects to auth)
  - Callback redirects with `?shop=xxx&installed=true` params to signal successful auth
  - HMAC verification implemented in callback.js for OAuth security
